! This is a namelist file created from :infiles/extra_hydrogen.inp 
! This is a CTP file

! 'TF' stands for 'this field'
! ONE equals TRUE unless specified otherwise
 
!These are offsets applied before the call to the single arm montecarlos.
! Offsets are in spectrometer coordinate system.  Positive xptar offset
! means spectrometer is positioned at large xptar (i.e. below target, and
! thus pointing above target and giving a negative shift to particle's xptar)
